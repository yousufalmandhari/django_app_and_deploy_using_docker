Concepts covered in the lab:
1) Django project: Defines the structure of your application and configuration files.

2) Django app: A Django application that includes models , views , templates, URLs, and other resources like static files.

3) View: A function that determines what to do with incoming requests, and how to generate the corresponding response.

4) URL or urls.py: Serves as the central URL configuration for your application, mapping incoming URL patterns to corresponding view functions or class-based views.

5) Template: A file that defines the structure and presentation of the output to be rendered and displayed in a web browser.

6) Docker: An open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment and management of applications within isolated environments called containers.

7) Containerization: An isolated environment that contains all the necessary dependencies and configurations required for an application to run reliably across different computing environments.
